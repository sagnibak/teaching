# Sagnik's Teaching Materials :sparkles:

I have taught CS 189 and CS 70 as a TA :fire: and as a
[Computer Science Mentor](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/) :seedling: for several
semesters. This repository contains all the teaching materials that I
have created/used over the years.

## CS 189 (Machine Learning)
- [Code :rocket:](/189-code)
- [Spring 2021 :fire:](/sp21)
- Spring 2020 :fire:: This is in another repo, I will add it here sometime later.

## CS 70 (Discrete Math and Probability Theory)
- [Code :rocket:](/70-code)
- [Fall 2021 :fire:](/fa21)
- [CSM Spring 2021 :seedling:](/csm-sp21)
- [Fall 2020 :fire:](/fa20)
- [CSM Fall 2020 :seedling:](/csm-fa20)
- [Summer 2020 :fire:](/su20)
- CSM was in-person in Fall 2019 and Spring 2020, so I don't have any online materials for those semesters :sweat_smile:.
